## What is Python ?
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the
use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming 
paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.

## What is Django ?
Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-view architectural pattern.

## What is Redis ?
    
Redis is an in-memory data structure project implementing a distributed, in-memory key-value database with optional durability. 
The most common Redis use cases are session cache, full-page cache, queues, leader boards and counting, publish-subscribe, and much more. in this case, we will use Redis as a message broker.

## What is Pandas ?

Pandas is an open-source Python library that provides data structures and data analysis tools for handling and manipulating large datasets. It offers two primary data structures: Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrame (two-dimensional), which allow for efficient data storage and manipulation. Pandas is widely used for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization. It supports operations like filtering, grouping, merging, and aggregating data. The library integrates well with other Python libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, making it a powerful tool for data scientists and analysts working with structured data.

## What is Scikit Learn ?

Scikit-learn is an open-source Python library widely used for machine learning and data analysis. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data modeling, covering tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Scikit-learn is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, ensuring seamless integration with these libraries. It offers various algorithms for training models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and more. Additionally, it includes utilities for model selection, preprocessing, and validation, making it a comprehensive toolkit for building and evaluating machine learning models.
